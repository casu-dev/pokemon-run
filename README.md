# Pokemon Battle Woods

## Ideas for future
- Floor layout like Binding of Isaac
- Z-moves
- Implement items/events, that motivate/force the player to change strategy during the run
- Back option via cancel button in all menus
- Option to train against bosses
- Place easter eggs

## Open tickets


## Closed tickets
- [x] Show move descriptions in Pok√©mon selection
- [x] Implement Hall of Fame history
- [x] Rework TM shop UI
- [x] Limit TM shop items and make them rerollable
- [x] Add more precise descriptions to the game
- [x] Fix Rayquaza bug
- [x] reset_moves considers Stab bonus, phy/special attack stat and type coverage
- [x] First and last event shouldn't be "useless" events. This means the first event of f1 mustn't be Egg-move Tutor or Tm shop (maybe also ban the mart?). And the last event on F4 mustn't be the wishing well event.
- [x] Change the current ability descriptions back to the old ones.
